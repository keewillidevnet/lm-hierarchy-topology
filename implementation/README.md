# Implementation Status

## UniLoRa Mesh LM Hierarchy Prototype

**Status:** Early prototype, active development  
**License:** Apache 2.0  

### Current Implementation

- **Tiny LMs:** ESP32-based TTGO T-Beam devices running lightweight keyword spotting and rule-based summarization
- **Small LMs:** Raspberry Pi 5 devices running Python-based LM with summarization and caching logic  
- **Large LM:** Cloud-hosted container running GPT-style inference with trust policy enforcement
- **Transport:** LoRa mesh networking for constrained environments

### Features Implemented

✅ `lm-request` RPC handling  
✅ `model-escalation` for hierarchical delegation  
✅ JWT-based token validation
